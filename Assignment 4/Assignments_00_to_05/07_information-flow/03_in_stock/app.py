"""
Sophia has a fruit store. She has written a function num_in_stock which takes a string fruit as a parameter and returns how many of that fruit are in her inventory. Write code in main() which will:

Prompt the user to enter a fruit ("Enter a fruit: ")

Call num_in_stock(fruit) to get the number of that fruit that Sophia has in stock

Print the number which are in stock if Sophia has that fruit in her inventory (there are more than 0 in stock)

Print "This fruit is not in stock." if Sophia has none of that fruit in her inventory.

Here's two sample runs of the program (user input in bold italics):

Enter a fruit: pear

This fruit is in stock! Here is how many:

1000

Enter a fruit: lychee

This fruit is not in stock.
