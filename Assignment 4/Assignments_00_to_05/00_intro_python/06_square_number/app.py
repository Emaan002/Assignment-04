# square number

"""
Ask the user for a number and print its square (the product of the number times itself).

Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

Type a number to see its square: 4

4.0 squared is 16.0

"""

def main():
    user_input = float(input("Type a number to see its square: ")) # take value from user in input

    print(f"{user_input} squared is {user_input ** 2}") #  Calculate the square of the user number and display message with squared value


# This line ensures that the main() function runs when the script is executed
