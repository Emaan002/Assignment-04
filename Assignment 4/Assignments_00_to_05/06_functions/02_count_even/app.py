"""
Fill out the function count_even(lst) which

first populates a list by prompting the user for integers until they press enter (please use the prompt "Enter an integer or press enter to stop: "),

and then prints the number of even numbers in the list.

If you'd prefer to focus on the second task only, scroll down for our implementation of the first task!
