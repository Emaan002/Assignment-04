"""
Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

Howdy Sophia ! 🤠

"""

def get_name():
    return "Sophia"  # Return the fixed name

def main():
    name = get_name()  # Get the name from get_name()
    print(f"\nHowdy {name}! 🤠\n")  # Print greeting message


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
