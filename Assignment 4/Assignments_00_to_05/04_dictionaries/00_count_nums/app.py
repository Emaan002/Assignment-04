"""
This program counts the number of times each number appears in a list. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the information.

An example run of the program looks like this (user input is in blue):

Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 4 Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 6 Enter a number: 4 Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 12 Enter a number: 3 appears 3 times. 4 appears 2 times. 6 appears 1 times. 12 appears 1 times.
